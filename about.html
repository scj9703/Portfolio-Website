                <h1>Hi, I'm Sam.</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>I'm studying Computer Science at the <span>Rochester Institute of Technology</span>, where my love for creating and tinkering has led me to pursue a career in software development. I love learning new things, and I've gathered knowledge on a wide variety of technologies during my studies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Much of my free time is spent on my <span>game development</span> hobby, where I volunteer as a developer for the <a href="https://main.jingames.net/">JinGames</a> modded Minecraft server. Under my pseudonym 'Mighty', I create <span>multiplayer content</span> that supplements the JinGames Minecraft mods for players to enjoy, largely through the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/customnpc-plus">CustomNPCs+ mod</a> for content creation. I also work with <span>support and bug report tickets</span>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've used <span>JavaScript ES5</span> quite a bit in this role, mainly for <span>NPC scripting</span> to create enjoyable boss battles or minigames that go far beyond anything normally possible in plain Minecraft. Other times my scripts are used for server utilities, anti-exploit measures, or data collection.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During my time here I also <span>co-created a mod of my own, 'Spirit Control.'</span> It's an addon for the JinGames core mods, created with <span>Java</span> and built with <span>Gradle</span>. It adds some new features to our combat system, like Super Attacks, Passive Abilities, a Super Attack Meter, and a customizable loadout. It also has <span>JSON config support</span> for easy server-sided balancing, and a <span>scripting API</span> to allow content creators to work with the mod in JavaScript. You can find the mod as well as the aforementioned scripts on my <a href="https://github.com/scj9703">GitHub page</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But that's not all I have experience with. <span>Front-End Development</span> projects are among my favorites, and I've been working to hone my skills in <span>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>. This website in particular was a lot of fun to create. I've also utilized <span>TypeScript</span> and the <span>Angular framework</span> to build the UI for a medical needs application as a term project.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the same aforementioned project, I worked with our <span>Back-End</span> team to make our application have access to the services provided by our <span>Java Spring REST API</span>. While this was an academic project, we used real industry practices, <span>Agile</span> methodologies, unit testing, and thorough documentation. You can view our design doc <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C-rtMFBDgfPeRKbuXmTAslTHqlK_LHtq/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>, or check out an overview of the term project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uidfd_U-bDseWsVkv3cHvjQQTqNGmuD_/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've got a taste of a few other languages too. I've learned <span>C#</span> to make some console applications in multithreading and basic cryptography. I've used <span>Python</span> for a wide variety of projects, everything from <span>artificial intelligence</span> to implementing specific program requirements. I also know some <span>SQL</span>, from my database term project for movie storage.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the moment, I'm looking for a <span>co-op experience in Software Development</span>. If you have problems that need solving and my variety of skills and drive for creative solutions interest you, feel free to <a href='mailto:scj9703@rit.edu'>shoot me an email</a>.</p>
